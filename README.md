# Knights-travails
Project to use data structures to express how and where a knight from chess can move across the chessboard from any position to any other position. 

We will use either BFS or DFS to find the shortest path for the Knight to get from one square on the chessboard to another. The chessboard will be represented by a graph data structure created with an adjacency list/array. 

We will first create a script to move the knight anywhere on the board using this graph structure while ensuring no move goes off the board. We will implement a strategy pattern to choose whether to use BFS or DFS algorithm. This choice will depend on what the start and end location are. 

Expansion

We plan to expand on this project by making a simple player-to-player chess game.
